# Leaflet_Challenge_15
Challenge 15 - Data Visualization and Analytics
In this challenge, yyou have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public 
and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Steps - Part-1 and Part-2 are together
Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. Get your dataset. from the USGS GeoJSON Feed
2. Import and visualize the data
   * Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
   * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
   * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
   * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)
1. Plot a second dataset on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
2. Add other base maps to choose from.
3. Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
4. Add layer controls to your map.
